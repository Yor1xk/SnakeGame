# Snake Game in C++

Snake Game project made using C++ and SDL3 (WIP for now). Obviously you need to download SDL3 to compile the project. After installing the library run 
```
g++ main.cpp -I <include path of the library> -L <lib path> -l SDL3 -o <executable_name>
```
You may or may not be required to put SDL3.dll file found in binaries of the library on the same level as your executable.
